# GimkitCheat

All you need to do to run the script is to copy the code from script.js and paste it into the console while on gimkit. After seeing a question once, it'll remember that and the next time you see it it will color it in green and move it to the bottom right. Once you've answered all the questions once you can spam your mouse at the bottom right.

## Getting Kicked

Sometimes if you answer too fast Gimkit will kick you out of the game. While it's not entirely understood the conditions for this to happen, you can circumvent it by taking breaks or slowing down. (It does only appear to happen in Classic mode, though.)

## Color in answers

When starting the script you get prompted on whether or not you want to color in answers or not. Selecting no will still move the correct answer to the bottom right, but it's less obvious.

## Disabling/Enabling the script on the fly

By hitting shift three times in quick succession, the script will toggle between being enabled and disabled.

### Notes on text answers:

Gimkit, for whatever reason, forces you to type into the input box before submitting a text answer. This script tells you the correct answer, but you still need to type it in.

### Disclaimer

This script is not endorsed by Gimkit in any way. You assume all responsibility for using this. It's also really annoying to test this, so it's not guaranteed to work on all browsers. If you find any bugs, please report them [here](/issues).
