# Gimkit Cheat

## Usage

When in a Gimkit game, open the console (Ctrl+Shift+I) and paste the code for your desired gamemode. Read below for more information for each gamemode.

## Gamemodes

Any gamemode specific script will pull up a hud to manage the script, which can be disabled by hitting shift 3 times.

### [General](/general.js)

This script works on all gamemodes. After answering a question, it automatically saves it, and will highlight / move the correct answer once it comes up again. Do be wary, as answering too fast may cause you to be kicked. This script is disabled entirely by hitting shift three times.

### [Classic](/gamemodes/classic.js)

This should not be used in conjunction with the general script.

The trick for classic is loosely based around a trick found in [non-reai's Gimkit hack](https://github.com/non-reai/Gimkit-Hacks) to answer questions, rather than manually storing and answering questions. It automatically answers questions and purchases upgrades, allowing you to sit back and relax.

### [Fishtopia](/gamemodes/fishtopia.js)

This should be used in conjunction with the general script.

Automatically answers questions, sells fish without being at the sell station, and allows you to fish without being at water. After using a "travel to..." thing (such as the travel to purple pond boat), you will be able to permanently use it from anywhere.
