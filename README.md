# Gimkit Cheat

V2 Of Gimkit Cheat is loosely based around a trick found in [non-reai's Gimkit hack](https://github.com/non-reai/Gimkit-Hacks) to answer questions, rather than manually storing and answering questions. If you still want to be try that out or want to be more inconspicuous, you can still use it [here](/v1).

## Usage

When in a Gimkit game, open the console (Ctrl+Shift+I) and paste the code for your desired gamemode. From there, a hud will prompt you with what to do. If you ever want to disable this hud, hit shift three times.

## Gamemodes

#### Note: general and gamemode specific scripts should not be used together, unlike in v1.

[General](./general.js)

Automatically answers questions, and can be used in any game. While toggled on, manually answering question will usually result in them being marked wrong.

[Fishtopia](./gamemodes/fishtopia.js)

Automatically answers questions, sells fish without being at the sell station, and allows you to fish without being at water. After using a "travel to..." thing (such as the travel to purple pond boat), you will be able to permanently use it from anywhere.
