# GimkitCheat

All you need to do is copy the code from script.js and paste it into the console on gimkit. It'll start coloring in the correct answers to questions pretty quickly, and once you've answered all the questions you can spam your mouse at the bottom right.

### Notes on text answers:

Gimkit, for whatever reason, forces you to type into the input box before submitting a text answer. To circumvent this, the script types in the correct answer minus the last letter, and also tells you the correct answer. Unfortunately, this means that you have to manually type in a single letter each time.
