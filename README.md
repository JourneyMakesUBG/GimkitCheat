# GimkitCheat

All you need to do is copy the code from script.js and paste it into the console on gimkit. After seeing a question once, it'll remember that and the next time you see it it will color it in green and move it to the bottom right. Once you've answered all the questions once you can spam your mouse at the bottom right.

## Getting Kicked

Sometimes if you answer too fast Gimkit will kick you out of the game. If this happens you'll need to slow down in the future.

## Color in answers

When starting the script you get prompted on whether or not you want to color in answers or not. Selecting no will still move the correct answer to the bottom right, but it's less obvious.

### Notes on text answers:

Gimkit, for whatever reason, forces you to type into the input box before submitting a text answer. This script tells you the correct answer, but you stull need to type it in.
